      <h3>About me</h3>
      <div class="about"><p>I am interested in IT sphere due to the following reasons. Nowadays nobody can imagine our world without technologies. They make our life easier and help develop and explore inaccessible secrets of our life and planet. And I want to be part of the people who make this progress possible. I want to facilitate human interaction with technology and make it as comfortable as possible. Iâ€™m going to fill the lack of experience with a strong motivation and desire to learn something new. And if there is an opportunity to receive information from experienced developers then I will willingly take advantage of this.</p></div>
